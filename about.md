I have been developing software for more than 35 years. Most of the time in imperative, object-oriented languages. At the moment I am trying to dip my toes in the waters of functional programming. I had a hard time unlearning my imperative mindset, and I am still in the progress of it.

I also never had the urge to have a public code repository or to have a blog. But I need a place where I can put the things that I have learned and that I am still learning. So be aware, that everything that you might find here is incomplete, missleading or just wrong.
