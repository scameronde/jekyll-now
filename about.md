As the time of writing (2019) I am 49 years old. I started programming when I was 12 and never stopped doing so. The first time I earned money with programming was when I was 15 years old. Getting payed for what you love doing was a great experience. 

Consequently I did all to make it my profession. I went to University (Master Degree in Computer Science and Mathematics) but also worked in parallel as a part time programmer. After leaving University I worked for several companies in different roles: product development, project development, consultant and trainer (software quality and agile methods), Enterprise Architect (non programming architect, that was the worst decision), team and department manager (with department manager being the second worst decision). At the moment I am back to my roots working in product development, and I love it.

This site and repository is for my amusement only. Do not expect to find any fancy open source projects or examples of high quality code. As I always had the luck to be able to incorporate technologies and methods I am interested in into my professional work, I have no need for any side projects. What you will find here are first insights and code snippets while I start to explore something new to me.
